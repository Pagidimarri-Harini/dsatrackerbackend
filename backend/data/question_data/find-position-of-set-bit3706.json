    "problem": "<p>Given a number N having only one ‘1’ and all other ’0’s in its binary representation, find position of the only set bit. If there are 0 or more than 1 set bit the answer should be -1. Position of set bit '1' should be counted starting with 1 from LSB side in binary representation of the number.</p>\n<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>\n<pre><code>Input:\nN = 2\nOutput:\n2\nExplanation:\n2 is represented as \"10\" in Binary.\nAs we see there's only one set bit\nand it's in Position 2 and thus the\nOutput 2.</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>\n<pre><code>Input:\nN = 5\nOutput:\n-1\nExplanation:\n5 is represented as \"101\" in Binary.\nAs we see there's two set bits\nand thus the Output -1.</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Your Task:</strong><br>You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findPosition() which takes an integer N as input and returns the answer.</p>\n<p><strong>Expected Time Complexity:</strong> O(log(N))<p><strong>Expected Auxiliary Space:</strong> O(1)</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong><br>0 ≤ N ≤ 10^8</sup></code></pre>\n<p><strong>Company Tags:</strong> Microsoft</p>",
