    "problem": "<p>Given an integer array coins[ ] of size N representing different denominations of currency and an integer sum, find the number of ways you can make sum by using different combinations from coins[ ].</p>\n<p>Note: Assume that you have an infinite supply of each type of coin. And you can use any coin as many times as you want.</p>\n<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong>\nN = 3, sum = 4\ncoins = {1,2,3}\n<strong>Output:</strong> 4\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> Four Possible ways are: {1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}.</pre>\n<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong>\nN = 4, Sum = 10\ncoins = {2,5,3,6}\n<strong>Output:</strong> 5\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> Five Possible ways are: {2,2,2,2,2}, {2,2,3,3}, {2,2,6}, {2,3,5} and {5,5}.</pre>\n<p><strong>Your Task:</strong><br>You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function count() which accepts an array coins its size N and sum as input parameters and returns the number of ways to make change for given sum of money.</p>\n<p><strong>Expected Time Complexity:</strong> O(sum*N)<br><strong>Expected Auxiliary Space:</strong> O(sum)</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong><br>1 ≤ sum, N, coins[i] ≤ 10^3</p>",
