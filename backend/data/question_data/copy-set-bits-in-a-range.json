The task is consider set bits of y in range [l, r] and set these bits in x also.</p>\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Input:</strong> x = 10, y = 13, l = 2, r = 3<br><strong>Output:</strong> x = 14<br>Binary representation of 10 is 1010 and that of y is 1101. There is one set bit in y at 3'rd position (in given range). After we copy this bit to x, x becomes 1110 which is binary representation of 14.</li>\n<li><strong>Input:</strong> x = 8, y = 7, l = 1, r = 2<br><strong>Output:</strong> x = 11</li>\n</ul>",
