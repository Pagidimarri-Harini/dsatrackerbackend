You need to add 1 to it.</p><p>Example 1:</p><p>Input: LinkedList: 4->5->6 Output: 457 Explanation: 4->5->6 represents 456 and when 1 is added it becomes 457.</p><p>Example 2:</p><p>Input: LinkedList: 1->2->3 Output: 124</p><p>Your Task: Your task is to complete the function addOne() which takes the head of the linked list as the only argument and returns the head of the modified linked list. The driver code prints the number.</p><p>Note: The head represents the left-most digit of the number.</p><p>Expected Time Complexity: O(N). Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).</p><p>Constraints: 1 ≤ N ≤ 1021</p>",
