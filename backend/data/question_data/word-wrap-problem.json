Let K be the limit on the number of characters that can be put in one line (line width). Put line breaks in the given sequence such that the lines are printed neatly.<br>Assume that the length of each word is smaller than the line width. When line breaks are inserted there is a possibility that extra spaces are present in each line. The extra spaces include spaces put at the end of every line except the last one.<br>You have to minimize the following total cost where total cost = Sum of cost of all lines, where cost of line is = (Number of extra spaces in the line)2.</span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Example 1:</span></span></p>\n<pre><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Input: nums = {3,2,2,5}, k = 6\nOutput: 10\nExplanation: Given a line can have 6\ncharacters,\nLine number 1: From word no. 1 to 1\nLine number 2: From word no. 2 to 3\nLine number 3: From word no. 4 to 4\nSo total cost = (6-3)2 + (6-2-2-1)2 = 32+12 = 10.\nAs in the first line word length = 3 thus\nextra spaces = 6 - 3 = 3 and in the second line\nthere are two word of length 2 and there already\n1 space between two word thus extra spaces\n= 6 - 2 -2 -1 = 1. As mentioned in the problem\ndescription there will be no extra spaces in\nthe last line. Placing first and second word\nin first line and third word on second line\nwould take a cost of 02 + 42 = 16 (zero spaces\non first line and 6-2 = 4 spaces on second),\nwhich isn't the minimum possible cost.</span></span></pre>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Example 2:</strong></span></span></p>\n<pre><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Input: nums = {3,2,2}, k = 4\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: Given a line can have 4 \ncharacters,\nLine number 1: From word no. 1 to 1\nLine number 2: From word no. 2 to 2\nLine number 3: From word no. 3 to 3\nSame explaination as above total cost\n= (4 - 3)2 + (4 - 2)2 = 5.</span></span></pre>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Your Task:<br>You don't need to read or print anyhting.
